Dear People Operations,

I recently learned about several great opportunities at New Relic from my friend and former colleague, Karl Hiner. Your positions for Engineering Manager, Product Team and Engineering Manager, Realtime Analytics especially appeal to me. The bottom line is that I believe you have really awesome software and your Product First vision excites me because I believe it adds value to more people, generating solutions for a broader array of users. I am passionate about delivering quality software, enabling engineers to solve major problems with handcrafted solutions, and seek a stimulating position where smart, capable collaborators come together to deliver innovative solutions.

As a Manager, I value innovation, integrity of self and product, and mutual respect. Every member of the team is equally important and contributes to our collaborative success in delivering quality products. I build deep relationships, believing that supercharging otherâ€™s excitement is critical to inspiring success and driving results.  I lead by example, modeling the skills and behaviors I expect to be reciprocated. 

Through my personal and professional experiences, I have:
* Facilitated the promotion and recognition of my team, resulting in multiple direct reports receiving promotions quarterly, by identifying goals and challenges collaboratively with team members to bring out their absolute best, blocking weekly time for each person to work on their goals and professional development
* Empowered team members by evaluating individual strengths and pairing colleagues to work together in ways they wouldn't have imagined
* Standardized testing, code practices, and documentation to enable developers to align their mental model of how the software works with its behaviors and processes  
* Delivered consistent and quality software as evidenced by successful execution of projects including: application framework shells for the Savanna Platform versions 3 and 4, a full-featured publication component with templates, a custom User Interface (UI) widget library, and an updated interface for map analysis  
* Collaborated across socially complex divisions, supporting both a commercial and government market segment with the restructuring of the Thetus.com corporate website and establishing branding patterns for the Savanna Analysis Platform
* Delivered quality results by relying on my subject matter experts, communicating early and often, and understanding next steps to move things to completion while working ahead of my team to refine the opportunity requirements, clear obstacles and mitigate risk so they could focus on producing precise, timely solutions

In short, I enable teams to deliver impressive on time results with an infectious passion for solving challenging problems.
 
I am available for interviews at your request and look forward to speaking with you at your earliest convenience.  Thank you for your time and consideration.
