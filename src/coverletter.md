To whom it may concern,

I recently learned about the UI Manager, Web UI from your technical recruiter Aliina Sconniers.  I am passionate about delivering quality software, enabling engineers to solve major problems with handcrafted solutions, and I seek a stimulating position where smart, capable collaborators come together to deliver innovative solutions.
 
Through my personal and professional experiences, I have:
* Facilitated the promotion and recognition of my team, resulting in multiple direct reports receiving promotions quarterly, by identifying goals and challenges collaboratively with team members to bring out their absolute best, blocking weekly time for each person to work on their goals and professional development
* Empowered team members by evaluating individual strengths and pairing colleagues to work together in ways they wouldn't have imagined
* Standardized testing, code practices, and documentation to enable developers to align their mental model of how the software works with its behaviors and processes  
* Delivered consistent and quality software as evidenced by successful execution of projects including: application framework shells for the Savanna Platform versions 3 and 4, a full-featured publication component with templates, a custom User Interface (UI) widget library, and an updated interface for map analysis  
* Collaborated across socially complex divisions, supporting both a commercial and government market segment with the restructuring of the Thetus.com corporate website and establishing branding patterns for the Savanna Analysis Platform
* Delivered quality results by relying on my subject matter experts, communicating early and often, and understanding next steps to move things to completion while working ahead of my team to refine requirements, clear obstacles and mitigate risk so they could focus on producing precise, timely solutions

In short, I am passionate about enable teams to deliver innoviative, on time solutions.
 
I am available for interviews at your request and look forward to speaking with you at your earliest convenience.  Thank you for your time and consideration.
